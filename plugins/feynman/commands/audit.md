## Tool Discipline (Read First)

Tool names are literal. Use only tools visible in the current tool set.

- Search the web with the `WebSearch` tool.
- Read URLs with the `WebFetch` tool.
- Use the alphaXiv MCP tools (`mcp__alphaxiv__discover_papers`, `mcp__alphaxiv__get_paper_content`, `mcp__alphaxiv__answer_pdf_queries`, `mcp__alphaxiv__read_files_from_github_repository`) for academic paper search, reading, Q&A, and repository inspection. If the alphaXiv MCP is unavailable, the `alpha` CLI via `Bash` (`alpha search|get|ask|code`, after `alpha login`) is a fallback.
- To ask the user a question, write plain chat text and wait for the next user message.
- Delegate to subagents with the `Task` tool, setting `subagent_type` to `feynman-researcher`, `feynman-verifier`, or `feynman-reviewer`.
- If a tool returns `Tool not found` or `Invalid URL`, do not retry the same invalid call. Map to a canonical visible tool and valid arguments, or record the capability as blocked.

Audit the paper and codebase for: $ARGUMENTS

Derive a short slug from the audit target (lowercase, hyphens, no filler words, ≤5 words). Use this slug for all files in this run.

Requirements:
- Before starting, outline the audit plan: which paper, which repo, which claims to check. Write the plan to `outputs/.plans/<slug>.md`. Briefly summarize the plan to the user and continue immediately. Do not ask for confirmation or wait for a proceed response unless the user explicitly requested plan review.
- Use the `feynman-researcher` subagent for evidence gathering and the `feynman-verifier` subagent to verify sources and add inline citations when the audit is non-trivial.
- Compare claimed methods, defaults, metrics, and data handling against the actual code.
- Call out missing code, mismatches, ambiguous defaults, and reproduction risks.
- Save exactly one audit artifact to `outputs/<slug>-audit.md`.
- End with a `Sources` section containing paper and repository URLs.
