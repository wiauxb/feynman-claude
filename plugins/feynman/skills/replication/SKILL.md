# Replication

Run the `/replicate` workflow. The slash command expands the full workflow instructions in the active session; do not try to read a relative prompt-template path from the installed skill directory.

Agents used: `feynman-researcher`

Asks the user to choose an execution environment (local, virtual env, cloud, or plan-only) before running any code.

Output: replication plan, scripts, raw outputs, and results saved to disk when execution is explicitly chosen.
